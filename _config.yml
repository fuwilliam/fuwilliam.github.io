  Hey! I'm William (but I usually go by my last name) and I have about 5 years of experience working with data, more recently focusing in analytics engineering. I find enjoyment in interpreting and wrangling data into assets that facilitate access to reliable, actionable information!
  
  I started my career as an Excel guy, began constructing dashboards with various data viz tools, and then moved on to building ETL pipelines and delivering data models. With this baggage, I've been shifting towards learning SWE skills and best practices to keep up and become a better fit for the rapidly evolving fields of analytics and data engineering. 


  I'm pretty confident with:   <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Power BI</mark>, <mark>Data Modeling</mark>

  I'm fairly comfortable with:  <mark>Airflow</mark>, <mark>dbt</mark>, <mark>BigQuery</mark>, <mark>Athena</mark>, <mark>git</mark>, <mark>Tableau</mark>

  I know the basics of:   <mark>Spark</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark>, <mark>Docker</mark>

          A project built to answer the age-old question: who is the best rapper?
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project was conceived through a combination of my fandom of hip hop and my desire to
          learn and practice some software and data engineering skills.

          A list of hip hop / rap artists are compiled with certain criteria from the <mark>Spotify API</mark>
          and loaded to a <mark>Supabase</mark> database.

          Through a <mark>Flask</mark> web app, users are prompted to choose between two artists in a head-to-head matchup. 
          With the matchup results, the data is extracted to <mark>GCS</mark> and loaded to <mark>BigQuery</mark>.

          Staging and mart models are built and documented via <mark>dbt</mark>, then metrics are visualized 
          in a <mark>Power BI</mark> dashboard. A local instance of <mark>Airflow</mark> orchestrates the ELT pipeline.

          Overall, building this project has helped me bridge the gap between my BI centered background 
          and the skillset of the modern analytics engineer (plus some web dev basics!), while hopefully settling some music related debates.
