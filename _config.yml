  Hey! I'm William (but I usually go by Fu) and I have about 5 years of experience working with data, more recently focusing in analytics engineering.
  
  I started off as the Excel guy, began delivering dashboards with various data viz tools, and then moved on to building ETL pipelines and delivering data models. With this baggage, I've been shifting towards learning SWE skills and best practices to become a better fit and keep up with the rapidly evolving fields of analytics and data engineering. 

  Overall, I find enjoyment in wrangling data into assets that facilitate access to reliable, actionable information.  

  I'm pretty confident with:   <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Power BI/Tableau/Qlik</mark>, <mark>Data Modeling</mark>

  I'm fairly comfortable with:  <mark>Airflow</mark>, <mark>dbt</mark>, <mark>BigQuery/Athena</mark>, <mark>git</mark>

  I know the basics of:   <mark>Spark</mark>, <mark>Scala</mark>
